# FlappydaVinci
My first Unity game! I decided to follow a YouTube tutorial to get started. The Flappy Bird spin-off I created is a Leonardo da Vinci–inspired 2D animation game. I spent two weeks developing a feature that requires players to recognize and know da Vinci’s works in order to progress through the game.
