# FlappydaVinci
My first Unity Game. Decided to follow a tutorial on You Tube (https://youtu.be/XtQMytORBmM). The Flappy Bird spin off I went with was a Leonardo da Vinci style 2D animation game. I worked on a feature for 2 weeks that involves the player to know about da Vinci's works in order to progress in the game.
